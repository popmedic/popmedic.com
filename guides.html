            <blockquote>
            	This will focus on using <a href="https://github.com/popmedic/mp4dvd#mp4dvd" target="_blank">Mp4DVD</a>, <a href="https://github.com/popmedic/mp4split#mp4split" target="_blank">Mp4Split</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/popmedic/mp4autotag#mp4autotag" target="_blank">Mp4Autotag</a> to make professional back-ups of DVD movies and tv series.  First, we will use Mp4DVD to back-up the content of media with <b>as-little-as-possible</b> lossy compression. Then, compress and encode the content to mp4 for playback on <b>as-many-as-possible</b> different players.  Along the way we will use Mp4Split to pull out the different Chapters for Show Episodes (if we have too), and also use Mp4Autotag to add the meta-data to the MP4 so it shows up in iTunes just like a episode or movie you buy though iTunes Store.
