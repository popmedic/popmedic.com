<h3>Guides:</h3>

    No guides yet, but I want to produce the following guides:
    <ul>
        <li>
        	How to rip DVDs and Blu-rays on a Mac.
            <blockquote>
            	This will focus on using MakeMKV, Mp4Split, and Mp4Autotag to make professional backups of DVDs and Blu-ray videos.  First, we will use MakeMKV to "rip" the content of media with <b>as-little-as-possible</b> lossy compression. Then, using Mp4Split we will compress and encode the content to mp4 for playback on <b>as-many-as-possible</b> different players.  Along the way we will use Mp4Split to pull out the different Chapters for Show Episodes (if we have too), and also use Mp4Autotag to add the meta-data to the MP4 so it shows up in iTunes just like a episode or movie you buy though iTunes Store.
