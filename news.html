        <blockquote>
            Mp4DVD is now release worthy.  It does it all with static linking of all the libaries, well mp4v2 is 
            still dlopen'd, I just like doing it that way, it seems cool...
            <p></p>
            Going to add DVD copy option that will just mirror the dvd into a directory.  This will make it so that
            Mp4DVD can do what Mac-The-Ripper used to do.  Oh, but mine will always be free!
            <p></p>
            Of course, I added Sparkle update support... would make that mistake twice...

            Added all the Sparkle support so I can go live with Mp4Split.  I made the mistake of going live without 
            Sparkle updates once and that is a mistake you only make once ;-)

            Lined up for the future of Mp4Split, these features will impove the ease of backing up show Dvds:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Chapter/time dialog to add splits for every x chapter/time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Segment exclusion from segments table.
                </li>
                <li>
                	Clean up the UI...
                    <ul>
                    	<li>
                        	highlight and scroll to last added split.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        	drag/drop movie onto window.
                        </li>

      	<h4>Mp4Dvd</h4>
        <blockquote>
            Mp4Dvd is a totally new project.  Using libdvdread this project is a GUI for ripping DVD's into Mp4's.  Just
            drag the dvd to the window, select the titles you want, and rip the Dvd.  Really simple UI.  Chapter marks are
            placed in the ripped mp4, so you can split up those show Dvds quickly with mp4split.  This is the first step in 
            professionally backing up your DVDs.  As usual, all code is available on my GitHub repos.  
            <p></p>
            Lined up for the future of Mp4Dvd:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Statically link all the code so users don't have to install libdvdread and libdvdcss from 
                    homebrew/port/build.
                </li>

        <h4>Mp4Split</h4>
      	<blockquote>
            So cleaned up the UI a bit and added the chapter feature.  Still need to add chapter preservation, not 
            looking forward to all the math behind it.  Decided against a "Jump to..." feature and instead added a 
            bunch of &lt;cmd&gt;&lt;Key&gt; controls for scrubbing.  Still takes forever to load MKVs even with the 
            QT &gt 7.0 asynch QTMovie loading.  Gonna have to keep looking into this.  By adding the -copyts option 
            to the ffmpeg options has fixed the convertion for most types.
            <br />
			<br />
			Should I make a tool same as mp4split for adding chapter marks to mp4s?  
            <br />
			<br />
  			I am working on Mp4Dvd.  Mp4Dvd is close to finished as I mention above.
            Once Mp4Dvd is finished, see it puts the chapter markers in so we can make clean splits on them, Mp4Split 
            will be used to split up episodes if you ripped a show dvd.  All will be clear with the white paper.

        <blockquote>
            Nothing new here, although there should be.<br />
           <p></p>
            I think I might completely redo this project.  I think I want better data management and project design.  
            Keep thinking I should remove the proxy server and make the regex filename parsing done in a pretty c++
            class using posix regexs and threaded search requests.

        <h4>Mp4Split</h4>
        <blockquote>
            I have been really busy with a new version of PopMSplit.  PopMSplit has a more specified function, which lead to a name change.  PopMSplit is now only supported for splitting into mp4 files.  If the source file is another format, it will be split and exported into an mp4.  This "new more specified function," along with Mp4Autotag's success, made me change the name to "Mp4Split."  So, from here on out, PopMSplit will for ever be known as Mp4Split.  I completely revamped the GUI, making it look and feel similar to Mp4Autotag.  Controlling playback of the editor is now easier, faster, more accurate, and I have big plans for the future.
            <p></p>
            Lined up for the future  of Mp4Split will be:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Jump to... control feature that will allow for string command jumping around in the movie.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Chapter indexes will be loaded and available to jump to from the menu bar.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Segment exclusion from segments table.

            Released v0.1.4 beta of Mp4Autotag!<br />
            Just some minor bug fixes.<p></p>
            Lined up for the future of Mp4Autotag will be:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Clean up the GUI.  I want to have it like Mp4Split does it.  I will have progress bars in the bottom left corner of the windows, and that way you will not be stuck modeled anymore. Also change the splitters to look like Mp4Split's splitters.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add a "cancel" to the tagging.  So when doing automated auto tags, you can cancel out cleanly.

         <h4>PopMedia3.0</h4>
        <blockquote>
            Popmedia is an idea and project that I use at my house and want to provide to others.  The concept is simple: A transparent media server that uses apache with mongrel to expose directories to various different clients.  Using meta-data and the file-system alone (NO INDEXING, SCANNING, DATABASING, nothing, just the files and file system alone).  This make a much more friend experience because... you don't have to wait a year to see changes, or spend hours cleaning up bad scans.  Currently there is a working HTML client, with zip downloads and access to the servers administration, and a Roku client, with searching, BIF files, and meta-info viewing.<br />
            <p></p>
            Lined up for the future of PopMedia3.0 will be:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Some form of instructions on how to install and use this beast.

         <h4>Scripts</h4>
        <blockquote>
            Added all of my sweet command-line ruby scripts to github.  This organized me, and also provided the code to others for use as they see fit. The added scripts are:
              <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://github.com/popmedic/dvd2mp4-cl">dvd2mp4</a> - This script uses vobcopy and ffmpeg to rip a DVD.  It is a great example of reading cl stdio and creating your own stdio out of it.  It also shows the steps for ripping a DVD on the command-line.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://github.com/popmedic/m4a2mp3-cl">m4a2mp3</a> - This script uses id3lib-ruby and mp4info along with faad and lame to convert a m4a (stupid iTunes audio file, just stick with the damn standard fools'), into a mp3 file.  A great example of using id3lib-ruby and the cl application mp4info and mp4art.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://github.com/popmedic/ffmpeg-cl-wrappers">ffmpeg wrappers</a> - A set of Ruby scripts for dealing with ffmpeg output on the command line.  A great example of using popen to run shell executables with captured stdio and personal stdio.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://github.com/popmedic/roku-buildbifs">Roku Buildbifs</a> - A Ruby script for creating Roku BIF files.  A great example of how to make a BIF file with ruby, little endians guys!
